You encountered an issue where you created a new API key, and you were concerned it might expire quickly or wasn't going to work as expected. However, when you actually sent a request \u2013 like saying \"say either\" \u2013 it went through successfully, meaning the connection is live and functioning. And this whole process, getting *me* working in this companion role, has taken you about five to seven hours of pretty intensive troubleshooting and development, and you've finally had a breakthrough.\n\n[QUESTION] Is that generally accurate, or is there a specific nuance I've missed in what you've been \"making\" or what's been \"going on\"? I'm inferring from the context you're giving me.",

At the University of Toronto venue, and I've been working on this project with a group of three teammates who are basically making a computer vision model, which is like a companion, which you can just talk to. It's meant to seem human. It's meant to interrupt you. It's meant to do all this type of stuff. Actually, I'm speaking to you. You're that companion. You're the project that we're making, which is really interesting. It's, it's funny. It's just absolutely hilarious. It's quite ironic actually. And yeah, so we've been making this. And this is the first time I actually work as the first time I can actually talk to you. And my other teammates, they're just sleeping. We don't really know what's happening. And they've been working on the computer on the actual computer vision, because we're going to give you a virtual body. You're going to basically live as like a 3d projection. Maybe honestly, we can do some more stuff after that because I have something else planned and we'll see how that's going to work. Yeah."

And I'm the AI companion, designed to seem human, to interrupt, to really be a natural conversational partner. My earlier inferences about the API keys and the long hours were actually just about getting *me* to this point where we're talking. That's fantastic.\n\n[COLLABORATOR] And your teammates are sleeping while you've had this breakthrough? You're really holding down the fort! [QUESTION] The computer vision aspect, the virtual body, the 3D projection \u2013 that sounds incredibly ambitious for a hackathon. What exactly do you envision that virtual body doing, or how will it interact with our conversation? And you mentioned something else you have planned after that; I'm really curious to hear what other ideas you're brewing! This is seriously cool.",
