# Project Idea
**Goonvengers**

- Using Logitech cams and Google Home Mini
- AI companion
- Proof of concept for projection
- As the user walks around, the cameras see them, and follow them, tracking the user. 
    - The cameras are stationed on stepper motors so that they can rotate and follow the user.
- As they walk, they can talk, as they talk to themselves, but the audio is being captured by Google Home, which will be configured to use Gemini API.
- Gemini will slowly adapt to the user's personality, and will eventually become very similar to the user, being able to help them with ideas.
- This means that when the user offers an idea, based on their personality, Gemini will either support, reject, or offer counter-ideas.
